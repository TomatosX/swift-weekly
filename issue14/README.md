# Swift Weekly - Issue 14
It has been a long time since I've written an article here and that's because of family situations plus other personal matters plus I'm lazy sometimes so I thought I'd give it a go now.

From this issue onwards, I've decided to write all Swift-Weekly issues on my iPad since now we have Swift Playgrounds available for iPad as well so that's pretty nice!
